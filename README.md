Solar Radiation Measurement Data Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of solar radiation data to support MoonLight Energy Solutions' strategic approach for solar investments. It leverages Python's powerful data analysis libraries (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn) to extract insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques.

Benefits:

Identify regions with high solar radiation potential for optimal solar panel placement.
Understand the impact of environmental factors (temperature, wind, etc.) on solar radiation.
Gain insights into how cleaning events affect solar sensor readings.
Support data-driven decision-making for MoonLight Energy's sustainability goals.


Prerequisites:
# describe each of libraries with functionalities in this project
pandas (pip install pandas)
NumPy (pip install numpy)
matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
seaborn (pip install seaborn)
scipy (pip install scipy) # for Z-score calculation
