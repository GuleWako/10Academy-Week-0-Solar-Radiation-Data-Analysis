# Solar Radiation Measurement Data Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of solar radiation data to support MoonLight Energy Solutions' strategic approach for solar investments. It leverages Python's powerful data analysis libraries (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn) to extract insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques.

Benefits:

Identify regions with high solar radiation potential for optimal solar panel placement.
Understand the impact of environmental factors (temperature, wind, etc.) on solar radiation.
Gain insights into how cleaning events affect solar sensor readings.
Support data-driven decision-making for MoonLight Energy's sustainability goals.



# The libraries used in solar radiation analysis:

# pandas: 
Loading, cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing the solar radiation data.
# NumPy: 
Performing numerical calculations, such as statistical analysis and correlation.
# matplotlib: 
Creating visualizations like time series plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots to explore the data.
# seaborn: 
Generating statistical visualizations and enhancing plot aesthetics.
# scipy: 
Calculating Z-scores for outlier detection and performing other statistical operations.
